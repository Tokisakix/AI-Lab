# ResolutionFOL

- `ResolutionFOL_v1.py`：Basic version. Able to handle most simple tests.

  CANNOT handle complex formulas.

- `ResolutionFOL_v2.py`：Improved version (main logic encapsulated & modified). 

  The improved version is able to handle complex formulas like:

$$
\text{Predicate}(f(g(h(x))))
$$

- `lab3.md`：Report. Written based on `ResolutionFOL_v2.py`.
